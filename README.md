# coastal_flood_maps_arcpy

This repo is make up by a single notebook which explains the methodology followed for the creation of **flooding maps** using (1) a DTM (2) and a shapefile with the polygons of areas of influence. The variable for flooding the DTM pixels is the Total Water Level (TWL), using the bathtub method.
<br/>The supporting package used for the geoprocessing analysis is the **ArcGIS' ArcPy package**.

An example of the final output can be seen in the following image:
